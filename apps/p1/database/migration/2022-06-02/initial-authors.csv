He has been having fun with computers for over 30 years. During that period he has worked on most types of software, from firmware, through tinkering with operating systems and device drivers, to writing games, and commercial applications of all shapes and sizes. In recent years Dave has worked in the field of low-latency systems and was a contributor to the Duke award-winning &apos;LMAX Disruptor&apos;, open-source project.</p><p>He started working in large scale distributed systems about 25 years ago, doing research into the development of loose-coupled, message-based systems-a forerunner of today&apos;s Micro-Service architecture. He has a wide range of experience leading the development of complex software in teams, both large and small, in the UK and USA.</p><p>Dave was an early adopter of agile development techniques, employing iterative development, continuous integration and significant levels of automated testing on commercial projects from the early 1990s. He honed his approach to agile development in his four and a half year stint at ThoughtWorks where he was a technical principal working on some of their biggest and most challenging projects.</p><p>Dave is currently working as an independent software developer and consultant.</p>'|
Sam|Newman|'<p>Sam Newman is an author, speaker, and independent consultant interested in cloud, continuous delivery and microservices.

Joshua|Bloch|"<p>Joshua J. Bloch (born August 28, 1961) is a software engineer and a technology author, formerly employed at Sun Microsystems and Google. He led the design and implementation of numerous Java platform features, including the Java Collections Framework, the java.math package, and the assert mechanism. He is the author of the programming guide Effective Java (2001), which won the 2001 Jolt Award, and is a co-author of two other Java books, Java Puzzlers (2005) and Java Concurrency In Practice (2006).</p><p>Bloch holds a B.S. in computer science from Columbia University and a Ph.D. in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University. His 1990 thesis was titled A Practical Approach to Replication of Abstract Data Objects and was nominated for the ACM Distinguished Doctoral Dissertation Award.</p><p>Bloch has worked as a Senior Systems Designer at Transarc, and later as a Distinguished Engineer at Sun Microsystems. In June 2004 he left Sun and became Chief Java Architect at Google. On August 3, 2012, Bloch announced that he would be leaving Google.</p><p>In December 2004, Java Developer&apos;s Journal included Bloch in its list of the ""Top 40 Software People in the World"".</p><p>Bloch has proposed the extension of the Java programming language with two features: Concise Instance Creation Expressions (CICE) (coproposed with Bob Lee and Doug Lea) and Automatic Resource Management (ARM) blocks. The combination of CICE and ARM formed one of the three early proposals for adding support for closures to Java. ARM blocks were added to the language in JDK7.</p><p>Bloch is currently a faculty member of the Institute for Software Research at Carnegie Mellon University, where he holds the title ""Professor of the Practice"". In addition to his research, Bloch teaches coursework in Software Engineering.</p>"|1961-08-28

It presents a system of modeling and design techniques that successful teams have used to align complex software systems with business needs and to keep projects agile as systems grow large.</p><p>Eric now leads “Domain Language”, a consulting group which coaches and trains teams applying domain-driven design, helping them to make their development work more productive and more valuable to their business.</p>'|
Martin|Fowler|"<p>I am Martin Fowler: an author, speaker… essentially a loud-mouthed pundit on the topic of software development, primarily for Enterprise Applications. I work for Thoughtworks, a software delivery company, where I have the exceedingly inappropriate title of ""Chief Scientist"". I have written half-a-dozen books on software development, including Refactoring, and Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture. I write for and edit the website martinfowler.com.</p><p>My main interest is to understand how to design software systems, to maximize how much value development teams can deliver. In doing this I&apos;ve looked to understand the patterns of good software architecture, and also the processes that support software design. I&apos;ve become a big fan of agile approaches and the resulting focus on evolutionary software architecture. I don&apos;t come up with original ideas, but do a pretty good job of recognizing and packaging the ideas of others, or as Brian Foote describes me: <strong>""an intellectual jackal with good taste in carrion""</strong>.</p>"|1963-12-18
