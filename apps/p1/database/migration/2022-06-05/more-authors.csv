Jane|Austen|"'<div>Though the domain of Jane Austen&apos;s novels was as circumscribed as her life, her caustic wit and keen observation made her the equal of the greatest novelists in any language. Born the seventh child of the rector of Steventon, Hampshire, on December 16, 1775, she was educated mainly at home. At an early age she began writing sketches and satires of popular novels for her family&apos;s entertainment. As a clergyman&apos;s daughter from a well-connected family, she had an ample opportunity to study the habits of the middle class, the gentry, and the aristocracy. At twenty-one, she began a novel called ""The First Impressions"" an early version of <strong>Pride and Prejudice</strong>. In 1801, on her father&apos;s retirement, the family moved to the fashionable resort of Bath. Two years later she sold the first version of <strong>Northanger Abby</strong> to a London publisher, but the first of her novels to appear was <strong>Sense and Sensibility</strong>Pride and Prejudice (1813), <strong>Mansfield Park</strong> (1814), and <strong>Emma</strong> (1815). After her father died in 1805, the family first moved to Southampton then to Chawton Cottage in Hampshire. Despite this relative retirement, Jane Austen was still in touch with a wider world, mainly through her brothers; one had become a very rich country gentleman, another a London banker, and two were naval officers. Though her many novels were published anonymously, she had many early and devoted readers, among them the Prince Regent and Sir Walter Scott. In 1816, in declining health, Austen wrote <strong>Persuasion</strong> and revised <strong>Northanger Abby</strong>, Her last work, <em>Sandition</em>, was left unfinished at her death on July 18, 1817. She was buried in Winchester Cathedral. Austen&apos;s identity as an author was announced to the world posthumously by her brother Henry, who supervised the publication of <strong>Northanger Abby</strong> and <strong>Persuasion</strong> in 1818.</div>'"|1775|12|16

Alexandre|Dumas|'<div><strong>Alexandre Dumas</strong> (1802–1870) lived a life as romantic as that depicted in his famous novels. He was born in Villers-Cotterêts, France. His early education was scanty, but his beautiful handwriting secured him a position in Paris in 1822 with the du&apos;Orléans, where he read voraciously and began to write. His first play, <em>Henri III et sa cour</em> (1829), scored a resounding success for its author and the romantic movement. His lavish spending and flamboyant habits led to the construction of his fabulous Château de Monte-Cristo, and in 1851 he fled to Belgium to escape creditors. Dumas&apos;s overall literary output reached more than 277 volumes, but his brilliant historical novels made him the most universally read of all French novelists. With collaborators, mainly Auguste Maquet, Dumas wrote such works as <em>The Three Musketeers</em> (1843–1844); its sequels, <em>Twenty Years After</em> (1845) and the great mystery <em>The Man in the Iron Mask</em> (1845–1850); and <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em> (1844). His work ignored historical accuracy, psychology, and analysis, but its thrilling adventure and exuberant inventiveness continued to delight readers, and Dumas remains one of the prodigies of nineteenth-century French literature.</div>'|1802||
