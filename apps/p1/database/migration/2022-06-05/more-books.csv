978-0399501487;Lord of the Flies;"<div>When ""Lord of the Flies"" appeared in 1954 it received unprecedented reviews for a first novel. Critics used such phrases as ""beautifully writeen, tragic and provocative... vivid and enthralling... this beautiful and desperate book... completely convincing and often very frightening... its progress is magnificient... like a fragment of nightmare... a dizzy climax of terror... the terrible spell of this book..."" E.M. Forster chose it as the Outstanding Novel of the Year. ""Time and Tide"" touched upon perhaps the most important facet of this book when it said, ""It is not only a first-rate adventure but a parable of our times, "" and articles on this and subsequent Golding novels have stressed these twin aspects of Golding: a consummate control of the novel form, and a superb all-encompassing vision of reality which communicates itself with a power reminiscent of Conrad.</div><div><span><em>""Lord of the Flies is one of my favorite books. I still read it every couple of years""</em></span></div><div><span><strong>—Suzanne Collins, author of The Hunger Games trilogy</strong></span></div><div><span><em>""I finished the last half of Lord of the Flies in a single afternoon, my eyes wide, my heart pounding, not thinking, just inhaling....My rule of thumb as a writer and reader—largely formed by Lord of the Flies—is feel it first, think about it later.""</em></span></div><div><span><strong>—Stephen King</strong></span></div><div><span><em>""This brilliant work is a frightening parody on man&apos;s return [in a few weeks] to that state of darkness from which it took him thousands of years to emerge. Fully to succeed, a fantasy must approach very close to reality. Lord of the Flies does. It must also be superbly written. It is.""</em></span></div><div><span><strong>—The New York Times Book Review</strong></span></div>";en;2003-12-16;(SELECT ID FROM PUBLISHERS WHERE NAME = 'Penguin Books');224;AVAILABLE;lord-of-the-files-william-golding-mass-market-paperback-2003-12-16;/assets/books/covers/lord-of-the-files-william-golding-mass-market-paperback-2003-12-16.png

However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighborhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters. ""My dear Mr. Bennet,"" said his lady to him one day, ""have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"" Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. ""But it is,"" returned she; ""for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."" Mr. Bennet made no answer. ""Do you not want to know who has taken it?"" cried his wife impatiently. ""You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.""
